# WORK TASK

**Please read this document thoroughly** and plan your work accordingly.
When ready, fork the repository and create a feature branch. It is in this branch we
expect your delivery.

This Work Task is divided into three parts:

### 1: CSS-wizardry

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hmfe/54321/master/button.png)

Recreate this button using only HTML/CSS and using as few HTML-elements as
possible. (HINT: It is possible to solve this using only one `<button>`)

- You can provide a solution for this separately or as a part of the solution for (3) \*

### 2: Please answer the questions found in the link below

https://sv.surveymonkey.com/r/QCT8SHL

### 3: Implement a simple search application

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hmfe/54321/master/search.png" style="width: 400px">
Implement a simple search form. The search should use a public REST API of your
choice using JavaScript.

- Search for title, return title (or something like that)
- Display partial search results in a list beneath the search field (Auto complete)
- Display the selected results in an editable list beneath the search component

  - Selected search result should be saved with date/time stamp (as a
    search history)
  - User should be able to delete a result from the list or delete the entire
    list.

- The application should be responsive, adapting to changes of the viewport.

### What we will look at:

- HTML5: Semantic markup, SEO optimization, Accessibility

  - Use HTML5 and show us that you have deep knowledge of semantic
    markup.

- CSS3: Responsivity, use of pseudo elements, HTML entities and complexity
  of solution

  - Surprise us with interesting solutions and show off your skills!
  - NOTE: Solution based on premade CSS frameworks will be completely discarded

- JS: complexity, sanity, comments and security.

  - The search should fetch data for each entry, don’t store a complete
    database response in a variable and iterate through that.
  - Sanitize your inputs and don’t stress the API more than necessary.

- General sanity check on structure and solution
  - Show to us that you know - how front-end development should be
    done.

When done, push your branch and let us know it’s done by making a pull request.

**Good Luck and have fun!**

# Feature Specific Readme

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
